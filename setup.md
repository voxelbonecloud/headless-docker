# Setting up a basic headless


## Prerequisites

You will need to have Git, Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system in order to use this project.

Instructions for installing Docker on common Linux distributions can be found at [docs.docker.com/engine/install](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)


You will also need to be supporting Resonite at a tier that is high enough to access the Headless - at the time of writing this guide, this is the "Discoverer" tier.

## Getting the Headless beta code

While in Resonite, find the Resonite bot in your Contacts list.

Send `/headlessCode` to the bot and it will respond with the Headless beta code. Note this down and keep it in a safe place for future reference.


## Installation

Start by downloading the files from this repository.
